We found that it was immpossible to implement a true reference monitor in xv6. In fact, xv6 already has a reference monitor implemented in the form of virtual memory. Originally, our concept of a reference monitor was a actually device or implementation. While working on this project, we found that the reference monitor is a concept, not an implementation. While we did not succeed with our original goal, we came away with a deeper understanding of a reference monitor. ",
