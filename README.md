# Resume Template

**Live Site**: https://oparkins.com

## Purposes

This is Owen Parkins' online resume. I have always wanted to have a website where 
I can continuously add my projects, but I didn't have the time to originally create it. 
For a class assignment, I found Tim Baker's [resume template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template)
and adapted it for my purposes. While I used Baker's resume as the design basis for 
my template, I wanted to remove all jQuery from the website. First, I dislike 
jQuery (just a lot of bloat for a resume site), and secondly I wanted to control more
of the site through React only.

I will be continuously updating this website with all my new projects because I no
longer have a space for them on my resume. 

## Want to use it?
If you like the website format, just fork it. The main data is stored in the [resumeData.json](./public/resumeData.json) file.

I just ask that my name is somewhere visible on the site and there is a link back to the GitHub repo. Much like what I did for Tim Baker in the footer.


## Comments? Concerns? Issues? 

Feel free to make a GitHub issue to contact me about the website. I can't help your individual website, but if you have a question about why I coded the way I did, or have a suggestion to make my website in a more React format, let me know! I am always willing to learn.
